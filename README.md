# Welcome to Velir!
## Please read all of the instructions before starting the excercise.

## Instructions
This Exercise should take up to 3 hours.

Imagine that you’ve been handed this code from a 3rd party vendor. Looks like it could use some improvements!

Some basic code has been provided (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), but please feel free to modify it and bring it up to web standards. The final code should be written with modern browsers in mind (Chrome, FF, Edge).

Please complete the tasks below so we can review your solutions and see how you would approach and solve day to day coding assignments. We'll be looking for task completion, best practices, accessibility, and any extra touches you'd like to include.

### Tasks

Constrain all content on the page so that it is at most 1200px wide and centered in the browser. If the browser viewport is below 1200px, all page content should still be visible without horizontal scrollbars.

Style the Multi Promo component to show a block of 2-4 promotional images and text. Use the Multi Promo space below to show how you would build a component that would work for this sort of promotion at all screen sizes (360 and up).
Use JavaScript to replace the [name] token in the heading as the user types a value in the text box.

Change the Instructions component into an accordion. Clicking on the Instructions text, should expand and collapse this rich text content.

In Code Pen's JS panel, there is a list of Cats. Using Javascript, please create an array of just the cat names and output the results to the console.
